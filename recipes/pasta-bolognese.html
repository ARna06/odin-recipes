    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Bolognese sauce is basically a pasta sauce made with ground beef, onions, tomatoes, and fresh herbs, and served with pasta. It’s an Italian meat sauce that originated from the city of Bologna. However, it’s more than just beef, onions, and a jar of spaghetti sauce. It’s about the depth of flavor you get from cooking all the ingredients in stages and letting the sauce simmer so it becomes thick, rich, and hearty. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Olive Oil: You have to use olive oil when making Italian food! Any other oil just won’t cut it.</li>
        <li>Onion, celery, and carrots: These ingredients form the base of flavor for a lot of your favorite soup recipes, and they do the same in Bolognese sauce.</li>
        <li>Garlic: You can add more if you’d like, but never add less!</li>
        <li>Lean ground beef: Because I don’t drain off the grease in this recipe, I recommend a lean ground beef to keep the sauce from being too greasy.</li>
        <li>Whole milk: I recommend sticking with whole milk, rather than swapping in a lighter version. It adds a lot of richness to the sauce.</li>
        <li>Crushed tomatoes: Crushed tomatoes give us more texture than canned tomato sauce, but they’re more broken down than diced tomatoes. This makes them perfect for pasta sauce.</li>
        <li>Tomato paste: Tomato paste isn’t just to intensify the tomato flavor; it also adds umami.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: You’ll need the standard salt and pepper, along with a bay leaf, oregano, and nutmeg.</li>
        <li>Tagliatelle pasta: Or your pasta of choice.</li>
        <li>Chopped parsley: For garnish.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sweat the onions, celery, carrots, and garlic in a large pot on the stovetop.</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef and season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Break up the beef and cook until it’s browned, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Stir in the milk and simmer until it mostly evaporates.</li>
        <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and remaining seasonings.</li>
        <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, then simmer on low, uncovered, until the sauce is thick and flavorful.</li>
    </ol>
